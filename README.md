# GAME: SNAKE

The classic game, snake takes me back to my years as a proud Nokia owner and i played this game so much.
This was a must for me to create when i starting coding. This code is very much based on the tutorial by Brocode on youtube. However i have later expanded on it to make it not only look alot better, but also a bit more effective code and also responsive to be played on touch devices.

So bring out your inner Nokia lover and get nostalgic with this timeless game!
